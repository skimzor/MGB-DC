# Game Boy Pocket (MGB) DC/DC Board
"Reverse engineered" an OEM Game Boy Pocket MGB DC/DC Board (rev LSEP01088A1) and recreated it in KiCad.

# Ordering

Upload the gerber to a PCB fab (JLCPCB, PCBWay, OSHPark) with a board thickness of 1.2mm and in your favorite color.  Then transfer the components from an original DMG Audio Board (verify the correct polarity of the diodes when transferring).  

# Disclaimer

I have not personally tested these as they were made for a member of the Game Boy community, so please use at your own risk.

If you identify any issues or have fixes, please contact me on discord: skimzor #5078
