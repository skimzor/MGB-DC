# Game Boy Pocket (MGB) DC/DC Board
"Reverse engineered" an OEM Game Boy Pocket MGB DC/DC Board (rev LSEP01088A1) and recreated it in KiCad.

I purchased a black one-to-one MGB PCB and transferred components from an OEM MGB; however, I did not like the color contrast between the green OEM DC/DC Board and the black mainboard PCB. There are other aftermarket options for a black DC/DC board, but I wanted to use the stock MGB screen so I needed to retain both the 5V and -18V rails.  

I desoldered components of a revision LSEP01088A1 DC/DC board, sanded it down, and then re-traced the tracks in KiCad.

# Ordering and Assembly

Upload the gerber to a PCB fab (JLCPCB, PCBWay, OSHPark) with a board thickness of 0.8mm and in your favorite color.  Then transfer the components from an original MGB DC/DC Board (verify the correct polarity of the diodes when transferring).  

Note: this PCB can only be used with components from a revision LSEP01088A1 MGB DC/DC Board.

# Disclaimer

Assembly of this PCB will require a donor MGB DC/DC and experience with desoldering and micro-soldering SMD components.  I do not take responsibility or accept blame for any damage to your Game Boy Pocket or MGB DC/DC Board.
